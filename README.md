## Project1
This repo contains machine learning model for predicting flight fares

It basically uses randomForest Algorithm to predict the flight fare(Dumped)

I have also tested with other algorithms such as Linear regression and KNN to check for the accuracy


## Project2

This contains password strength predictor

It uses logistic regression to counter the problem

## Project3

This contains machine learning model to predict stocks using Time Series Analysis

ARIMA Model
